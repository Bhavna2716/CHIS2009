# CHIS.R explores the "adult" subset from the California Health Information Servey 2009 (CHIS2009) dataset to better understand and #explain the collected health servey data. (the data is avaialble at http://healthpolicy.ucla.edu/.) 
#The CHIS.R file is a collection of codes from multiple CHIS excises that were part of the Case study chapter in the ggplot2 part 2 course. 
#The original datacamp exercise had the "adult" file loaded in the exercise but here in CHIS.R file it has been loaded from a local #esktop. 
#Following are some additional packages that were later added to the original code. (They were automatically loaded in the datacamp exercises)  
#("tidyverse") 
#("ggthemes")
#("car") 
#library(haven) (In order to read the SAS format of chis2009 file)
